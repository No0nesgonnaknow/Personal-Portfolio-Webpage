              JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
              It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
              (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
              objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
              them.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
              Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
              operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
              be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
              additional objects; for example:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
                For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
                clicks, form input, and page navigation.
              </li>
              <li>
                Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
                server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
                another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
                server.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
              different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
              does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
              JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
              and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
              renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
              declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
              number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
              values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
              more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
              provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
              for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without
              any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
              objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
            </p>
            <p>
              JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
              have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
              to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
              protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
              parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

            <header>HTML</header>
          </header>
          <p>
            <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a fundamental language used in web development to create 
            the structure and layout of web pages. It is the standard markup language for the World Wide 
            Web and is supported by all modern web browsers. HTML uses a system of tags to define the elements 
            and content of a webpage.</p><br>
            
            <p>An HTML document consists of several key components. The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is used to specify 
            the HTML version being used. The html tag serves as the root element, and within it, we have the head
            and body sections. The head section contains metadata, such as the page title, character encoding, 
            and linking to external stylesheets or scripts. The body section holds the visible content of the webpage.</p><br>
            
            <p>HTML elements are represented by tags. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets and usually come 
            in pairs—an opening tag and a closing tag—although some tags are self-closing. The opening tag 
            denotes the start of an element, while the closing tag signifies its end. Elements can be nested 
            within one another to create a hierarchical structure.</p><br>
            
            <p>Text content is added between the opening and closing tags of an element. Headings are marked up 
            using h1 to h6 tags, with h1 representing the highest level and h6 the lowest. Paragraphs are 
            denoted by the p tag. Other common text-level elements include strong for strong emphasis, em for 
            italic emphasis, a for hyperlinks, and span for inline styling.</p><br>
            
            <p>HTML also provides elements for creating lists. The ul tag represents an unordered list, while 
            the ol tag represents an ordered list. List items are denoted by the li tag, which is nested within 
            ul or ol tags.</p><br>
            
            <p>Images can be included using the img tag, which requires a source (src) attribute specifying the 
            image file location. The img tag is self-closing and can include additional attributes like alt text 
            for accessibility and width/height for sizing.</p><br>
            
            <p>Tables can be created using the table tag, with rows defined by tr tags and cells within each row marked 
            up with td or th tags for data and headers, respectively.</p><br>
            
            <p>Forms, used for user input, are essential in web development. Form elements include input for various 
            types of input fields, such as text, checkboxes, radio buttons, and more. The select tag creates a dropdown 
            menu, and the textarea tag is used for multiline text input. The form itself is defined by the form tag and 
            typically contains a submit button.</p><br>
            
            <p>HTML also allows for the inclusion of multimedia elements. The audio and video tags enable the 
            embedding of audio and video content, respectively, within a webpage. These tags support various 
            attributes to control playback and appearance.</p><br>
            
            <p>To enhance accessibility and improve SEO, HTML offers semantic elements like header, nav, section, article, footer, 
            and more. These elements provide meaning and structure to the content and are beneficial for search engines 
            and assistive technologies.</p><br>
            
            <p>In addition to the core HTML elements, developers can extend HTML's capabilities using custom 
            data attributes, CSS classes, and JavaScript interactions.</p>

            <header>CSS</header>
          </header>
          <p>
            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a fundamental technology used in web development to control 
            the visual presentation and layout of HTML elements on a webpage. It allows developers to apply 
            various styles, such as colors, fonts, sizes, margins, and positioning, to enhance the overall appearance 
            and user experience of a website.</p><br>
            
            <p>CSS works by targeting HTML elements using selectors and applying styling rules to those elements. 
            Selectors can be based on element types (e.g., h1, p), classes (e.g., .my-class), IDs (e.g., #my-id), 
            or other attributes. By combining selectors with specific styling properties, developers can create 
            customized and visually appealing designs.</p><br>
            
            <p>CSS provides ways to define the color of text, backgrounds, borders, and other elements. Color values can 
            be specified using keywords, hexadecimal values, RGB values, or HSL values.</p><br>
            
            <p>CSS enables control over font families, sizes, weights, styles, and text decorations. Developers can 
            specify fonts from the system, using web-safe fonts, or by importing custom fonts through services like Google Fonts.</p><br>
            
            <p>The box model defines the structure and layout of elements on a webpage. It consists of content, 
            padding, borders, and margins. CSS allows developers to adjust the size, spacing, and positioning of 
            elements within the box model.</p><br>
            
            <p>CSS offers a range of techniques to create responsive layouts. Flexbox and CSS Grid are powerful layout 
            systems that allow developers to build complex and flexible designs that adapt to different screen sizes and 
            orientations.</p><br>
            
            <p>CSS provides the ability to animate and transition properties over time, creating visually appealing effects. 
            With keyframes, developers can define custom animations by specifying the desired styles at different points in time.</p><br>
            
            <p>Media queries allow developers to apply specific styles based on different device characteristics, 
            such as screen width, resolution, or orientation. This enables the creation of responsive designs that adapt 
            to various devices, from mobile phones to large desktop screens.</p><br>
            
            <p>CSS selectors determine which elements the styles should be applied to. Understanding selector 
            specificity is crucial for resolving conflicts when multiple styles target the same elements.</p><br>
            
            <p>CSS preprocessors, such as Sass and Less, introduce additional features and efficiencies to CSS by 
            enabling the use of variables, mixins, functions, and nested styles. They help streamline the development 
            process and improve code maintainability.</p><br>
            
            <p>CSS is a versatile and powerful tool that, when used effectively, allows developers to transform the 
            look and feel of web pages. By combining CSS with HTML and JavaScript, developers can create visually 
            appealing, responsive, and interactive websites and web applications that cater to the needs of users across 
            different devices and platforms.</p>

            <header>JavaScript</header>
          </header>
          <p>
            <p>JavaScript is a versatile programming language that plays a fundamental role in web development. It is 
            primarily used for client-side scripting, allowing web developers to create interactive and dynamic elements 
            on web pages. Developed by Brendan Eich in the mid-1990s, JavaScript has since evolved into a powerful and 
            widely adopted language.</p><br>
            
            <p>One of JavaScript's key features is its ability to manipulate and modify HTML and CSS, enabling developers 
            to dynamically update the content and appearance of web pages. It provides a vast range of built-in functions 
            and methods that allow for handling user interactions, validating input forms, and performing calculations. 
            JavaScript also supports the creation and manipulation of elements, allowing for the addition or removal of 
            elements on a webpage based on specific events or conditions.</p><br>
            
            <p>Another essential aspect of JavaScript is its support for asynchronous programming through callbacks, promises, 
            and async/await syntax. Asynchronous operations, such as making API calls or fetching data from a server, can be 
            executed without blocking other parts of the script, enhancing the responsiveness and performance of web applications.</p><br>
            
            <p>JavaScript is not limited to client-side development; it can also be used on the server side with technologies 
            like Node.js. This allows developers to build full-stack web applications using a unified language. With Node.js, 
            JavaScript can handle server tasks, such as handling HTTP requests, interacting with databases, and managing file systems.</p><br>
            
            <p>The JavaScript ecosystem is vast and continuously expanding. It includes numerous frameworks and libraries, 
            such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, which provide tools and components to streamline web development. These 
            frameworks enhance productivity, enable the creation of reusable code, and facilitate the development of complex web applications.</p><br>
            
            <p>JavaScript has become a cross-platform language, extending beyond web browsers. It is now utilized in mobile 
            app development (using frameworks like React Native and Ionic), desktop application development 
            (with frameworks like Electron), and even in emerging technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices.</p><br>
            
            <p>In recent years, JavaScript has undergone significant updates, with the introduction of modern JavaScript 
            (ES6 and beyond) that brings new language features, improved syntax, and enhanced developer productivity. This includes 
            features like arrow functions, classes, modules, template literals, and more.</p><br>
            
            <p>However, as with any programming language, JavaScript has its challenges. Due to its flexibility and permissiveness, 
            it requires careful coding practices to avoid potential pitfalls and security vulnerabilities. Cross-browser compatibility 
            can also be a consideration, as different browsers may interpret JavaScript code differently.</p><br>
            
            <p>To become proficient in JavaScript, it is crucial to practice and gain hands-on experience. There are abundant 
            online resources, tutorials, and communities that provide support and guidance for learning and mastering JavaScript. 
            By leveraging the power of JavaScript, developers can create highly interactive and engaging web applications that enhance 
            user experiences and drive the modern web forward.</p>

          <header>Hello world</header>
          <article>
            To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
            your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
              greetMe("World");
            </code>
          </article>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
          <header>Variables</header>
          <p>
            You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
            The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
            dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
            Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
            "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
            (lowercase).
          </p>
          <p>
            You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
            identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
            characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
            Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
          <header>Declaring variables</header>
          <article>
            You can declare a variable in three ways:
            <p>
              With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This
              syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
            </p>
            <p>
              By simply assigning it a value. For example,
              <code>x = 42.</code> This always declares a global variable. It
              generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
              variant.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This
              syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See
              Variable scope below.
            </p>
          </article>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
          <header>Constants</header>
          <article>
            <p>
              You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword.
              The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
              identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign
              and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
            </p>
  
            <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
            <p>
              A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
              while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block
              scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is
              assumed to represent a variable.
            </p>
  
            <p>
              You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
              variable in the same scope. For example:
            </p>
  
            <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
              WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
              //statements }</code>
            However, object attributes are not protected, so the following
            statement is executed without problems.
            <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
              "otherValue";</code>
          </article>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
          <header>if...else statement</header>
          <article>
            Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
            true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the
            condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
  
            <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
            condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
            Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
            condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
            statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any
            statement, including further nested if statements.
            <p>
              You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
              conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
            </p>
            <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
              statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
              statement_last; }
            </code>
            In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition
            which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple
            statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In
            general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially
            when nesting if statements:
  
            <code>if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
              statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
              statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
              statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code>
            It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional
            expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when
            glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
            <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use
            an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
            additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:
  
            <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>
