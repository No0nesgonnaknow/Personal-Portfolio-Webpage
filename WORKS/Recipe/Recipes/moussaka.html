    <h1>Moussaka Recipe</h1>
  
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large eggplants</li>
      <li>500g ground beef</li>
      <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 can (400g) crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1 cup breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 cups milk</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).</li>
      <li>Slice the eggplants into 1/4-inch thick rounds. Brush them with olive oil and arrange them on a baking sheet. Bake for 15-20 minutes until tender. Set aside.</li>
      <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic. Sauté until the onion is soft and translucent.</li>
      <li>Add the ground beef to the skillet and cook until browned. Drain any excess fat.</li>
      <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, dried oregano, ground cinnamon, ground nutmeg, salt, and pepper to the skillet. Stir well and simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk constantly for 1-2 minutes to make a roux.</li>
      <li>Gradually add the milk to the roux, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Cook until the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>Spread half of the eggplant slices in the bottom of a baking dish. Top with half of the meat mixture and sprinkle with half of the grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
      <li>Add another layer of the remaining eggplant slices, followed by the remaining meat mixture and grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
      <li>Pour the white sauce over the top and sprinkle with breadcrumbs.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes or until the top is golden brown and bubbly.</li>
      <li>Garnish with chopped fresh parsley before serving.</li>
    </ol>
